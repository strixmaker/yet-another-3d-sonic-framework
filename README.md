# Yet another 3D Sonic framework 
## what a shocker...

So here we have a 3D Sonic framework for Unity 2020.2. It's pretty similar to the Infinity Engine that you'd find on Unreal Engine, except it's Unity now (*woah*)

**Now** you may question yourself: *"Why would this idiot make Infinity Engine for Unity when you can just get it on Unreal instead?"*
### And to that I say...

Tho it's pretty cool and functional so you can use it if you hate Unreal for some reason

### Usage:

You can either clone the repository with `git clone strixmaker/yet-another-3d-sonic-framework` or by just downloading the whole thing as a zip file. Either one, you'll need Unity 2020.2 or newer, and a PC that's not from the stone age since the framework uses HDRP (tho you can swap it for another render pipeline if you want to)
